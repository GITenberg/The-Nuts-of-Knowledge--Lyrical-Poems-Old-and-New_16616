<span class="i0">Where we sat at dawn together, while the star-rich heavens shifted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We were weaving dreams in silence, suddenly the veil was lifted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a hand of fire awakened, in a moment caught and led<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
<span class="i0">Upward to the wondrous vision: through the star-mists overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flare and flaunt the monstrous highlands; on the sapphire coast of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall the ghostly froth and fringes of the ocean of the light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many coloured shine the vapours: to the moon-eye far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the fairy ring of twilight mid the spheres of night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girdling with a rainbow cincture round the planet where we go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We and it together fleeting, poised upon the pearl glow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We and it and all together flashing through the starry spaces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a tempest dream of beauty lighting up the place of places.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half our eyes behold the glory: half within the spirit's glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoes of the noiseless revels and the will of beauty go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a hand of fire uplifted&mdash;to her star-strewn palace brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the mystic heart of beauty and the secret of her thought:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
<span class="i0">Here of yore the ancient mother in the fire mists sank to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she built her dreams about her, rayed from out her burning breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the wild will woke within her lighting up her flying dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round and round the planets whirling break in woods and flowers and streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the winds are shaken from them as the leaves from off the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the feet of earth go dancing in the way that beauty goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the souls of earth are kindled by the incense of her breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her light alternate lures them through the gates of birth and death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the fields of space together following her flying traces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a radiant tumult thronging, suns and stars and myriad races<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mount the spirit spires of beauty, reaching onward to the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Shepherd of the Ages draws his misty hordes away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the glimmering deeps to silence, and within the awful fold<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
<span class="i0">Life and joy and love forever vanish as a tale is told,<br /></span>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
